You can find here the scripts needed to build the RNA and protein feature library. 

You will need to acquire: 
- Ensembl 5'UTR, CDS, 3'UTR sequences (in fasta format). 
- Annotation files from RMVar database
- miR seed scores from miRDB
- per gene /per transcript annotation of sequence conservation to Danio rerio (I recommend to use the webinterface of biomaRt)
- Annotation files for PTMs from dbPTM (https://awi.cuhk.edu.cn/dbPTM/)
